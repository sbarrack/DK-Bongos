# DK Bongos (and Other Nintendo Controllers)
Expanding on the Donkey Kong bongos

I originally created this project to find the best way to make the Donkey Kong Bongos a tournament legal and competitive Smash Bros game controller. The code here is no longer used for bongo functionality, because I discovered that the best way did not require any programmable logic. However, I have left it here so that others may learn what took me a long time to hunt down and discover, in addition to functionality to support and emulate the controller devices I have experimented on.
